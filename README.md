## Brief introduction
Develop by Joaquin Olivera, member of SmartTraffic, this

initial investigation that was carried out by the project members.

## Requirements
For the application to work you need to have a polygon map of 
the spot you will considered to get the information you need 
of it, i.e the spot you can occupied or free.

This file need to be in the directory of the program, and 
have to be inside of PolyMap directory, if this directory 
doesn't exists you need to create it.

Inside this directory is waiting for the filename **Parking Spots.kml**
